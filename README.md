ArrowBotActivity
================

This project contains a small project that will be used to teach programming by implementing an autonomous robot in a small 2D space. It is written in Java at the moment, although a Python version may be in the works for later. The BadgerBots students and I will be adding to this as we go along, making the robot more and more autonomous. I look forward to seeing what this project brings!

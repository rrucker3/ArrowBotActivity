/**
 * ArrowBotActivity
 * This program will allow students to learn the ins and outs of robot programming.
 * An arrow, which we will pretend is a robot, will find its way through a maze.
 * The robot will first be manually controlled by the user. Then, we will work our way
 * up to an autonomous robot with knowledge of the location of the goal, then an
 * autonomous robot without knowledge of the location of the goal.
 * 
 * The grid will also vary in complexity. At first, it will have no obstacles, but it
 * will increase in difficulty and size until it resembles a maze.
 * 
 * Date of creation: 10/26/2013

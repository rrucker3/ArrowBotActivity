/*
 * When I had finished the robot moving part, I noticed that sometimes, the robot could
 * have a position outside the grid. This was no good, so I decided to create a type of
 * Position that would prevent a robot from existing outside of the grid. This class 
 * enforces this upon creation or setting of the position, but, since this class is an 
 * extension of Position, I didn't have to rewrite any of the code I used there. Object-
 * oriented programming at its most useful.
